                        <h2>What is Screen Printing?</h2>
                        <p>Screen Printing is a printmaking technique where ink is pressed onto a surface through a mesh screen, which acts as a stencil with areas blocked though an emulsion coating, to create an artwork.</p>

                        <h2>Origins</h2>
                        <p>What we today know as screen printing is a process that first developed in Japan and China, where silk was held between two pieces of strong, stencil-cut waterproof paper and the paper was glued together, allowing the paint to flow through the exposed silk.
                           It developed further during early 1900s, when Samuel Simon perfected a basic wooden frame method developing an emulsion that could be painted onto the silk to block out the images or stencils. This process came to be known as silk screening - a term that is still used today, even though most screens in the present are not made of silk. In the 20th century,  printing gained widespread recognition in both commercial and artistic settings. Most notably, it became a central tool in the Pop Art movement of the 1960s, popularized by artists like Andy Warhol, who used it to create bold, iconic imagery. </p>

                        <h2>Benefits</h2>
                        <li>Allows printing on a variety of surfaces- paper, plastic, fabric, metal, wood, glass, etc.</li>
                        <li>Seperation of layers preserves colour brilliance and artworks come out more vibrant than that from a digital printer.</li>
                        <li>Cost effiecient in long term as after the set up is done, high volumes of prints can be done in less time and resources.</li>
                        <li>Artworks produced are more durable compared to other printing techniques due to heavy ink coverage. After being cured, it can be resistant to UV rays, scratches, moisture, chemicals,etc. </li>
                        <li>Great to explore unexpected creative outcomes with offset registration!</li>

                        <h2>Role in Digital Era</h2>
                        <p>As digital printing becomes more and more common, there is a renewed interest for analog processes and screen printing is no exception to this. The tactile quality of these artworks can not be replicated by technology and thus it would continue to remain relevant alongside these digital tools. In a mass produced visual culture, these works stand out especially through zines, posters, merch, postcards,etc. </p>
